# 👋 Greetings!

### Python   C/C++  and exploring RUST

I'm a pre-final-year engineering student with a passion for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, low-level systems, and mathematics.  
I spend most of my time diving deep into **mathematics**, experimenting with **language models**, and exploring new ways to design next-gen **database systems**.  
Currently I'm busy contributing to **OSS** that I have used, and building intelligent systems with **Python**, **C/C++**, **PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow**, while also learning **Rust** to strengthen my systems programming skills or maybe to build stable **ML libraries** in Rust.
