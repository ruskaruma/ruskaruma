# 👋 Greetings!

I am a pre-final year electronics major working with math on language models and low-level systems. I am great with C++ and Python.
I spend my free time on OSS contributions, and I am working on my own research projects, which I like.

My best work so far is a custom attention and transformer kernel that I have written myself in C++, which isn't public yet because
it is part of a research work.
